# Manual Installation

This directory contains documentation to perform a **manual installation** of
the environment using CLI tools. This approach is fully hands-on, guiding you
step-by-step through the process.

The installation is done on virtual machines running under KVM/QEMU, not on
baremetal hardware. This allows for flexibility in testing and development while
maintaining control over every configuration detail.

Use this guide if you want to:

- Understand the complete manual setup process
- Customize every aspect of the installation
- Learn the underlying commands and tools involved
